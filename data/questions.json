Every morning, the principal monk arranges the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on the left rod, the smallest disk at the top, thus making a conical shape. He gives his disciple monks the task to move the entire stack to the right rod, obeying the following simple rules:</p><br><ol><br><li>Only one disk can be moved at a time.</li><br><li>Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.</li><br><li>No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.</li><br><li>A disk can only be moved to an adjacent rod.</li><br></ol><br><p>He claims that if a monk is able to successfully complete this task, he/she will gain enlightenment.</p><br><p>If the stack is made of 8 disks and a monk takes 5 seconds to move a disk, what is the minimum time (in seconds) in which he/she can gain enlightenment?</p>",
